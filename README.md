# Rightfoot Payments Demo

This demo application exemplifies an application, which provides the
functionality to make payments to student debt, similar to other payment outlets
like ACH transfers or credit card transfers to another person.

The application is an all-in-one [Angular](https://angular.io) app, which
includes:
 * UI elements to gather required payments information for a beneficiary.
 * Calls to Rightfoot APIs (normally located on an API Application's server)
 
A copy of this app with world-shared API keys is hosted at
[demo.rightfoot.com](https://demo.rightfoot.com). 

## Getting Started
This is an Angular app, so having some familiarity with the framework is
helpful, it isn't necessarily required.

### Installation
You'll need to be sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed with a
version >= 10.

We use yarn for managing dependencies.
[Install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) if you haven't
already, and install the dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

Run `ng serve` to launch a local dev server on port 4200. Navigate to
`http://localhost:4200/`.
